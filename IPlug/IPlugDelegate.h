/** This pure virtual interface delegates communication in both directions between the UI and the plug-in's main class/API class.
 *  It needn't be a "plug-in" that implements this interface, it can also be used for other things
 *  An example use case: you would like to pop up a custom preferences window with a few simple checkboxes.
 *  You should be able to do that with a new graphics context and something implementing this interface in order to send/receive values
 *  to/from your new UI.
 *
 *  Note on method names: "FromUI" in a method name, means that that method is called by the UI class. Likewise "ToUI" means 
 *  that the method is delivering something wait for it... to the UI.
 *  The words "FromDelegate" in a method name mean that method is called from the class that implements the IDelegate interface,
 *  which is usually your plug-in base class. A parameter value is a floating point number linked to an integer parameter index.
 *  A parameter object is an instance of the IParam class as defined in IPlugParameter.h, owned by IPlugBase.
 *  A parameter object is also referred to as a "param", in method names such as IPlugBase::GetParam(int paramIdx) and IControl::GetParam().
